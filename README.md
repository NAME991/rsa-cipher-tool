NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

OVERVIEW: This is a cipher tool that can encrypt and decrypt messages. It uses the RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) Algorithim to generate public and private keys needed to encrypt and decrypt. This is a 1st year capstone project for Computer Programming 2.

MAIN CHALLENGE: Reinventing the wheel by creating my own number percision algorthims. As external libraries are not allowed.
